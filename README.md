# 👋 Hi, I'm Rasmus — MSc Student in High-Performance Computer Systems | Engineer | Innovator

🎓 I’m currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in High-Performance Computer Systems** at **Chalmers University of Technology**, where I specialize in building fast, scalable, and intelligent systems designed to solve real-world problems.

🚀 From training custom GPT models and optimizing AI modules to developing signal processing tools and advanced frontend architectures — I thrive at the intersection of performance and precision.

🌍 I’ve been accepted to study abroad at **Tohoku University in Japan**, and I previously applied to **RWTH Aachen** through the UNITECH Programme — reflecting my commitment to international collaboration and continuous learning.

🛠️ My toolbox includes:
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Rust, Dart, VHDL, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C, C++, C#, Java, and more
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Flutter, Node.js
- **Libraries & Tools**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, MathJax, Ollama, Docker, Git

💡 I believe that technology should be strategic, scalable, and human-centered. I’m passionate about long-term innovation — building systems from the ground up, and empowering others through thoughtful, efficient design.

👨‍🏫 I also serve as a **Teaching Assistant** in Digital Design at Chalmers, guiding students in FPGA development and VHDL, and helping them grow both technically and analytically.

📈 Whether it's high-performance computing, deep learning integration, or sleek frontend development — I aim for clarity, speed, and real impact in every project I take on.
